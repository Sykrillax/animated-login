# Animated Login

Welcome to the **Animated Login** repository! This is my very first github repository.This is my experiment to create a dynamic login page, and can move according to the movement of the keyboard while filling out the login form. My experiment was inspired by a video I came across on Instagram hehe.

This project features a visually appealing login form with smooth animations, making your web application's user authentication process more engaging.
